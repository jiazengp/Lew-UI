    Spring is the burden of life and death; Summer is the
    <lew-mark>burst of desire</lew-mark>; Autumn is the resolution of karma;
    Winter is the <lew-mark bold="800" color="red">self-cultivation</lew-mark>.
    Spring, summer, autumn, winter and another spring represent the entire cycle
    of life. Lust awakens the
    <lew-mark color="mint">desire for possession</lew-mark>, which can lead to
    fatal consequences - what you like, others may like too.

    Money is both an angel and a
    <lew-mark round type="light" color="blue">devil</lew-mark>. When money is
    just enough to satisfy you,
    <lew-mark type="light" color="blue"
      >money is an angel; when money makes you feel like a pile of trouble, it
      becomes a devil. Money is flowing wealth.</lew-mark
    >Some people are generous to friends when they earn money, while others are
    <lew-mark color="green">stingy with themselves</lew-mark> when they have
    more money - there is divine guidance in all of this.
